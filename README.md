# Frontend-Storage-Practice


This is a **learning project** created to practice working with **cookies** and **localStorage** in JavaScript.

What it does

- A simple form with two input fields: **Name** and **Surname**.
- If you click **"Submit"**, it will greet you but **won’t store any data**.
- If you click **"Remember Info"**, it will:
  - Save your name and surname to both **cookies** (for 3 days) and **localStorage**.
  - Automatically fill in the form next time you open the page (within 3 days).

## ⚠️ Note

- This is **not** a real login system.
- No passwords or sensitive data are stored.
- This is a **safe, frontend-only learning demo**.
